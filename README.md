# DIY Flipper Zero Replication Project

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the functionality of the Flipper Zero, a multi-tool for pentesters and hardware hackers, using affordable components and open-source software. By utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, various RF modules, and an OLED display, you can create a versatile device capable of handling multiple types of signals, including sub-GHz frequencies, NFC, and Bluetooth communication.

## Components List
To build your version of the Flipper Zero, you will need the following components:

### Essential Components
- **ESP32 Development Board** (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC)
- **CC1101 RF Module** (for sub-GHz communication)
- **PN532 NFC/RFID Module**
- **OLED Display (0.96‚Äù I2C)**
- **MicroSD Card Module**
- **Breadboard** (for prototyping)
- **Jumper Wires** (Male to Male and other configurations)
- **Resistors** (e.g., 470 ohm, for LED and transistor circuits)
- **Transistors** (e.g., 2N2222 for signal amplification)
- **Shunt Resistor** (e.g., 10A for current measurement)
- **LEDs** (for status indication)
- **Battery Management System (BMS)** (for safe battery operation)
- **Power Supply** (compatible with the ESP32)
- **IR Transmitter and Receiver Modules** (for IR communication)

### Optional Components
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor** (e.g., DHT11)
- **Buzzer** (for audio feedback)
- **Bluetooth Module** (although ESP32 has built-in Bluetooth)
- **Custom Enclosure** (to house the components)

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Setup the ESP32**: 
   - Install the Arduino IDE and set it up for ESP32 programming.
   - Connect the ESP32 to your computer.

2. **Integrate the CC1101 Module**:
   - Connect the CC1101 to the ESP32 using SPI pins (MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS).
   - Use libraries like RadioHead or RF24 for communication.

3. **Add the PN532 Module**:
   - Connect the PN532 to the ESP32 via I2C.
   - Use libraries like Adafruit PN532 to handle NFC/RFID functionalities.

4. **Connect the OLED Display**:
   - Wire the OLED display to the ESP32 using I2C connections.
   - Use libraries like Adafruit SSD1306 for easy display management.

5. **Implement Bluetooth Control**:
   - Use the built-in Bluetooth capabilities of the ESP32 to create a mobile app interface.
   - You can use MIT App Inventor or Flutter to build a simple app that communicates with the ESP32.

6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Power on the setup and test each module to ensure they are functioning correctly.
   - Use serial debugging to troubleshoot any issues in the code or connections.

7. **Create Custom Menus and Interface**:
   - Program the OLED display to show menus and options based on user inputs.
   - Utilize button presses or Bluetooth commands to navigate through the options.

8. **Add MicroSD Support**:
   - Connect the microSD card module and use it for storing data logs or settings.

9. **Build a Custom Enclosure**:
   - Design and 3D print or use a pre-made enclosure to house your components, keeping the OLED display visible.

## Future Enhancements
- **Expand Frequency Support**: Consider adding more RF modules for different frequency ranges.
- **Integration of Additional Sensors**: Such as GPS or environmental sensors.
- **Cloud Integration**: For data logging or remote control functionalities.

## Conclusion
With these steps and components, you can create a DIY device that replicates many of the features of the Flipper Zero. This project not only helps you learn about electronics and programming but also allows for customization based on your specific needs.
